         <h2>From Argentina to Italy</h2>
<p>Horacio Pagani is the Argentine-Italian founder of Pagani Automobili, and Italian auto-maker best known for its hypercars and manufacture of carbon fiber. Pagani was born in Casilda, Argentina to Luca and Maria Pagani. Luca was a baker while Maria was a painter. At an early age Pagani took an interest in engineering while still living in Argentina, where he started working with fiberglass, and then began working with on a Limitada Santafisna race car. Although he had no background in mechanical engineering, Pagani was capable of building a working car with a Renault engine. The competition season was tough for him as he was not able to fix minor car problems due to the lack of money, but heâ€™s ability to come up with an innovative race car at an early age made him notable among famous drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, one of the most famous Formula One drivers at the time. Pagani asked Fangio to have him write letters to notorious car manufacturers such as Ferreari, Lamborghini, and Alfa Romeo. Pagain first struggled to find a job when he moved to Italy with his wife, but he was finally able to find a job at Lamborghini. At Lamborghini he first started sweeping floors, but he was able to work his way up the company until he became a designer and began building cars such as the Countach Evoluzione. This car was revolutionary because it was made from carbon fiber manufactured from an autoclave that Pagani bought with his own money, and it was a thousand pounds lighter than the original Countach.</p>
