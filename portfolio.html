   <h2>Pagani Automobili</h2>
<p>Although the Countach Evoluzione never made it into production, Pagani saw the potential of carbon fiber in cars, so he took his autoclave and left Lamborghini to start his own production company. Pagani became one of the best carbon fiber manufacturers rivaled only by McLaren and NASA as he was able to produce this material efficiently and many racing teams used his service to produce parts for cars and motorcycles. Pagani decided to design his own car and after seven years, he revealed his first work of art, the Zonda, made mainly from carbon fiber and a V12 engine from Mercedes. Pagani made several versions of the Zonda, and although they shared the same name, most of them were different as the company always improved each version to create the best car possible that carries elegant styling. After the success of the Zonda, Pagani released the Huayra, an hypercar carrying active aerodynamics along a complete redesign that follows the flow of the wind along the sides of the car, with side mirrors that were designed to look like a womanâ€™s eyelashes. The attention to detail for Pagani cars is what makes them stand out among exclusive car companies, and from humble beginnings, Pagani was capable of achieving his dream as an Italian car manufacturer, and his cars are not only considered fast hypercars, but works of art as well.</p>
